# What I learned about React Native in 7 days üì±

Recently, I found myself interested in mobile development üì± After spending three years doing and studying web development (both front-end and back-end as well as cloud infrastructure), I wanted to make the jump and learn something different üßê

So I tried React Native. A framework for developing cross-platform applications for iOS and Android (as well as other platforms).

I watched this crash course of 14 hours that was available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkEnidfZnCU
Learning by doing has been my favorite way of learning and the most efficient so far üí™

So here my few takeaways of this week üìÉ
- Developing on React Native is very similar to developing on React for web. There is some key differences such as the accepted tags (React Native uses `<View>`, `<Text>` and React uses standard HTML tags such as `<div>`, `<span>`).
- `Local storage` does not exist in mobile but instead there is `Async storage`.
- `React Navigation` seems to be the main library used for navigating between screens.
- `Redux Toolkit` has made using Redux so much simpler. I remember using Redux by configuring everything (actions, reducers, dependency injection) but Redux toolkit makes abstraction of all of this to allow us developers to focus on the logic
- Expo seems to be very standard for starting a React Native project.
- On these projects, I used the CSS framework `TailwindCSS` (using the package `nativewind`) for styling my application and I must say that I love it. It really makes your life easier by making you use utility classes so that you don't really need to write CSS (unless you need really custom styles).
- I also learned about the folder structure for a React Native project. These are the folders commonly created: `screens` (for storing the differents screens of the application), `components` (for reusable components), `assets`, `slices` (for Redux toolkit).

Building four mini-projects has taught me a lot and made me extremely excited about the future applications I will build in the near future üöÄ

# Authentication with HMAC üîê

This week, I also learned a new way of developing authentication for an API: HMAC authentication (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hmachash-based-message-authentication-code/).
One of the requirements of the project was to allow authentication for an organization as a whole instead of doing the authentication per user.

- Cryptographic hash function used is `SHA256`.
- When the organization is created, generate an `secret shared key` (symmetric key) unique to that organization that will be used for generating a signature client-side.
- When calling an authenticated API endpoint, the user will have to provide the following headers:
  - `X-Signature` which the HMAC signature generated from the following string.
    ```ruby
      # Example: POST:/api/v1/infos:2022-11-01T12:00:00:1:{"parameter":"value"}
      "#{request.method}:#{request.fullpath}:#{@header_datetime}:#{@header_organization_user_id}:#{body}"
    ```
  - `X-Organization-User-ID` (example: 1)
  - `X-Datetime` (example: 2022-11-01T12:00:00)
- As a result, the `X-Signature` will be different for every request.
- The server, upon receing the authenticated request, generates its own HMAC signature and compares it with the sent HMAC signature from the client. If they are both the same, the request is considered legitimate.
