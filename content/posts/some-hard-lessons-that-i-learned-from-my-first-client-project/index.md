After 3 years developing in-house products, I had the opportunity to work in a project of an external client for the first time. And well... I can say the way you work and approach things was completely different. Some things went well and others... not so much, like anything in life right? But it is important to not repeat the same mistakes from your past experiences. In this article, I will talk about some lessons that I learned (and re-learned) in that web development project.

**Note: I am not pointing fingers at anyone in this article. This article is only for self-improvement purposes.**

# 💪 What could have been improved

## 📚 More documentation
I joined the project in midway as a Backend Engineer so the codebase was already there with some core members already working on the main features. So I tried my best to catch up as quick as possible with the rest of the team.

It didn't took so much time but I thought that the lack the documentation (and comments in the code) made it very hard to understand what is happening sometimes.

## 📃 Implementation of guidelines
All the members (including me) were coding without following any defined guidelines so the codebase lacked consistency (pull requests description, coding style, comments, methods and variable naming...).

Consistency is quite important when it comes to code quality because it makes the code more predictable and easy-to-understand for everyone.


## ⏰ Do not compromise (too much) on code quality
One thing that really surprised me was the lack of quality overall (few tests, a lot of repeated code).

The members were very competent and were aware of that, no question about it! But the main cause of that was the tight schedule. The client wanted features to be delivered as fast as possible and assured us that refactoring would be possible at a later time (which unfortunately didn't happen because well... new features are more important for them that the code quality).

But this approach resulted in many bugs/inconsistencies with the specification because of the lack of time for writing tests, doing code reviews thoroughly... Thus forcing the developers to take more time to fix them, which is counter-productive as a result.

So talking with the client, making them understand about the importance of quality of the code and finally deciding on a more realistic schedule would be the solution I believe that would be beneficial to everyone.

Also, you are also the 'owner' of the code you write, so writing the best code and providing the best solution as you can should be your number one priority as a developer.

## 🔖 More solid specifications
In this project, there were quite a lot of specification changes happening during the implementation making the engineers re-do some parts sometimes.

It was easy to miss something in the final implementation. Also the changes were sometimes not reflected directly in the specification documents after talking about it.
I guess that determining the specifications in a solid manner so that no breaking changes would be later introduced, is crucial.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Making the wanted information easy to find for anyone
Sometimes, it was quite hard to find the information that I wanted to know. For example, you want to know why some pull requests were created but there were not any links to any resources or tasks to inform the reviewer. The solution would be to always put as much information as you can so that others can have all the cards in hands to understand what you are doing.

Another would be to share the information on the public channels as much as possible. That would help everyone be on the same page and having the same source of knowledge.

## 🏃🏻 Do not sacrifice your health for work
In such kind of projects where the schedule is quite tight, it is understandable to be forced to work more hours. But nevertheless, you should not sacrifice your physical and mental health by working too much.

That would be on the contrary counter-productive since you will easily make more mistakes if you are exhausted. Take the time to resource yourself and come back fresh and motivated.

# Conclusion
A lot of these problems were addressed and solved during the project so we ended up moving forward in a good direction 🚀

This project was a extremely good opportunity for me to learn and know more about the way you work in a client project.
I will make sure to create a more easy-to-work environment the next time I will take part in a similiar project 💪
